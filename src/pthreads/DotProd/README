This directory contains the skeleton of a dot product routine. It only goes so
far as to divide work and degenerate to a serial dot-product when a certain threshold
is reached. Also the dot-product itself is not done : The "C" array gets A[i] * B[i]
but I don't accumulate the "C" array itself.

Your task will be described in the assignment description.

Background info:

1) This is a good overview of how PThreads are managed: 
     https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs241/fa2010/ppt/10-pthread-examples.pdf

2) These notes may also help : Lec3-cs4230.pdf found at URL http://www.eng.utah.edu/~cs4230/

   Look at bPc.c which contains an actual usage of how PThread arguments are passed
   and results are collected.

   For your assignment, you will merely pass in one struct, and so the solution used
   in bPc.c should work without too much modification.
