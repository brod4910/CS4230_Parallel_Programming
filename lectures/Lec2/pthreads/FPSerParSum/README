Compile and run sersum.c and parsum.c for inputs going as follows:

4 1.2e-38
8 1.2e-38
16 1.2e-38
20 1.2e-38
21 1.2e-38
22 1.2e-38
23 1.2e-38
24 1.2e-38
25 1.2e-38
26 1.2e-38
27 1.2e-38

Comment on whether the same sum is being done (albeit in a left-linear
manner or a parallel balanced-tree manner). Observe the answer as we
increase the input range via the first arg. Where does sersum's answers
saturate? Does parsum's answers saturate? Explain what is going on.

Ans: parsum can faithfully double the answers while sersum saturates at
some point.
