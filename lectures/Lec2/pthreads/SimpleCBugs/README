One often begins coding up a new parallel program by first
writing a stub that may have a serial algorithm implemented,
and then embarking on a parallel version. The parallel version
itself may call the serial version if the calculations are
not worth parallelizing.

Ganesh began writing a simple Dot Product routine PThreadDP.c.
In the process, he created two prior variants
PThreadDPBuggy.c and PThreadDPLeak.c. The former crashed
nondeterministically, proving that testing is insufficient to
find out issues (it is always hit or miss). The second exited
silently due to a memory leak (not significant for this example,
but in general, such forgotten deallocations may be an issue).

Both these maladies were spotted by running the AddressSanitizer,
as the included files "asan-output-overlap.txt" and "asan-output-leak.txt"
show.
