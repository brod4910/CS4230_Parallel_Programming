This directory contains the pi approximation calculation
from Peter S. Pacheco's book "An Introduction to Parallel Programming,"
Chapter 4. The examples were kindly provided by the author at his website
http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~peter/.

Notable are these results:

1) Both busy-wait solutions presented in the book, namely pth_pi_busy1.c and
   pth_pi_busy2.c, despite being so well written, have data races.

   See "busy1-data-race.txt" and "busy2-data-race.txt" for how ThreadSanitizer
   was run to detect these races, and the race report itself.
   
   While once upon a time it was "OK" to write code with data races, things have
   meanwhile changed a lot. The C language standardization effort tells us that
   there is no such thing as a "benign race." 

2) The routine pth_pi_mutex.c does not have any detectable data race in it
   (detectable by ThreadSanitizer)
