Overall(Ganesh): Very well researched.

* I like the fact that you ran ISP on the trapezoidal routines.

* The explanations could be a bit longer wrt the actual algorithm

* The odd/even execution does not seem to be on the right example
  (how can you achieve odd/even sorting just using collectives?).

  I found out: you have not run it with the required args! So the
  ispUI plot is for a null execution.

  Required args are "g" and array size.

90 points (lack of more details, but mainly for odd/even not being on
   	  the right example; correct me if I am wrong)
