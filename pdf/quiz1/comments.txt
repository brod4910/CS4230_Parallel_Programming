Q1: Good summary. Did you see the power equations? We'll discuss
    it in class.

Q2: Good survey of concepts. 

Q3: You are converting the energy in a pizza to "wattage left over"?
    That is a bit non-kosher, as the 4234.7 Watts of power has to
    be now left over a period of time. You are also calculationg the
    total watts in a Pizza? Anyway, good that you went thru some of
    the units. A common confusion in this area is between energy
    and power (and I'm sure you know the difference; maybe a typo
    in your answer).

Q4: Very good that you drilled deep into this talk and got its gist. Kudos!


Q5: Very good understanding again!


Q6: Good aspects of his talk well summarized!


Q7: Great that you picked up on the variadic template. Great job.
