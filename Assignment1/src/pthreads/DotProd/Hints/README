Here is an experiment you can do with bPc.c

1) Copy it over to a CADE machine such as lab1-40.eng.utah.edu
2) There, type gcc -o bPc bPc.c -lpthread -lm
3) Type "time ./bPc 1000000000 1 &" and immediately type top
4) When the CPU % drops to a low value, quit out of top (type "q")
5) Repeat by typing "time ./bPc 1000000000 2&" and repeat the above
6) The last arg here is the # of threads. So now type "time ./bPc 1000000000 4"
7) Go up to the # of threads being 8
8) Notice that in "top", the CPU percentage goes up to a number close to 800
   and then it drop
9) Of course, things must be finishing faster as well.

Hope you had fun doing this Pthread execution.
